Determining presence of any kind of diseases is a skill which has always been needed by society and, up until recently, could only be performed meticulously by doctors with extensive training and experience. 

**_Our problem of interest is to be able to take advantage of the high computational power available nowadays by using various Machine Learning techniques upon patients’ data, in order to detect accurately and rapidly whether such patients are suffering from diseases._**

For this project, we have decided to focus on detecting the presence of _coronary heart disease_ using a dataset provided by UCL and Kaggle. The dataset’s creators were Andras Janosi, M.D., William Steinbrunn, M.D., Matthias Pfisterer, M.D. and Robert Detrano, M.D. 

Firstly, we have analysed our dataset using various _**data visualization and feature extraction**_ methods, among which the most beneficial for our project was __PCA__:
